	Click Reports, Standard Reports, Server Dashboard, and then expand the
	section Non Default Configuration Options.  It will show everything that
	deviates from the defaults.

*/





/*
	Server settings can be made outside of sp_configure too.  The easiest way
	to check out the service settings are to go into Start, Programs,
	Microsoft SQL Server, Configuration Tools, SQL Server Configuration Manager.
	Go there now, and drill into SQL Server Services, then right-click on each
	service and hit Properties.  The advanced properties for the SQL Server
	service itself can hide some startup parameters.

	
	Next, check Instant File Initialization.  Take a note of the service account
	SQL Server is using, and then run secpol.msc.  Go into Local Policy, User
	Rights Assignment, Perform Volume Maintenance Tasks.  Double-click on that
	and add the SQL Server service account.  This lets SQL Server grow data
	files instantly.  For more info:
	http://www.sqlskills.com/blogs/kimberly/post/Instant-Initialization-What-Why-and-How.aspx


	There are a few more server-level things I like to check, but I use the SSMS
	GUI.  Go into Server Objects, and check out Endpoints, Linked Servers, 
	and Triggers.  If any of these objects exist, you want to know.
	

	Now as long the SSMS GUI is open, we should set up Database Mail.  It is
	possible to script that out, but I like the GUI for that since I often use
	wildly different parameters for different clients or departments.

	Once Database Mail is set up, the below script will test it.

	Finally, time to go back to the users and ask questions:
	- Can the business operate if this server is down?
	- How many employees have to stop working if this server goes down?
	- Who should I call when the server goes down?
	- Is this server covered by any security or compliance regulations?
	We can use their answers to build a good backup & recovery solution.
